# Gameplay

## Respawn
You spawn from automatic navigo toilets.

## Exploration
Your starting point is your affected metro station. From there you can go on and explore the rest of the network.
Fraudsters appear everywhere outside of your station. You can locate a service door to go back easily to your starting point.

There are other stations you can visit. Some are overrun by fraudsters but not all of them.

## Fights
You can encounter users and fraudsters.

### Users
You can help users figure out a direction (you direct them to YOUR station).
You can control their ticket and punish them if they do not have the correct one (expired, wrong ticket).

Having users at your station generates a small amount of money every X turns.

### Fraudsters

They do not have a ticket and no respect for the RATP and its users ! PUNISH THEM ! BANISH THEM !
Killing a fraudster gives you a medium amount of money.

## Powerups
- ability to go back to home station from wherever by creating a temporary service door from any wall

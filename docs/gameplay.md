# Gameplay

## Respawn
You spawn from automatic navigo toilets.

## Exploration

## Fights
You can encounter users and fraudsters.

### Users
You can help users figure out a direction (you direct them to YOUR station).
You can control their ticket and punish them if they do not have the correct one (expired, wrong ticket).

Having users at your station generates a small amount of money every X turns.

### Fraudsters

They do not have a ticket and no respect for the RATP and its users ! PUNISH THEM ! BANISH THEM !
Killing a fraudster gives you a medium amount of money.

## Powerups
- ability to go back to home station from wherever by creating a temporary service door from any wall

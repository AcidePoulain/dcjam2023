# Organisation

## Git workflow
Please make a branch when working on a new feature. Your branch should be named `feat/<describe-your-feature>`.

Ensure you rebase from main regularly. Rebase from main before merging your branch to main.

### Commit naming
Whenever applicable, your commits should be related to an issue on github. Please include the issue in the following form in your commit message:
```
#<issue-number> Fixed reticulation of splines
```

# dcjam2023-boilerplate
Boilerplate code to use as a basic godot project for an entry in dcjam2023

This will provide us with a starting point on the day of the jam. Included in this repository are:
- A basic godot project containing a starting scene composed of a ground and a character
- Our folder structure
- Git configuration and instructions on how to setup everything to work on the game

Our game will target Windows and Linux with native builds. The renderer used does not allow
for consoles or web export.

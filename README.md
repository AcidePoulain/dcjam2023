# Our entry for Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023

Our game will target Windows and Linux with native builds. The renderer used does not allow
for consoles or web export.

We are making a game about the Paris Metro.

## What's the situation
### Who are you
You are the first station manager in a new metro stop. This is not a job description.
You are not human. You are an abstract entity at the service of the RATP. You only
have a human enveloppe to interact with the world. This enveloppe is not convincing to humans.
You are uncanny.

### What do you want ?
You want to help people figure out the directions to your station (even if they do not want to go there specifically).
You want to ensure they have their ticket.
The character you are playing does not have a concept of leaving the metropolitan transport network. You can not help people to leave.

### What is going on
There is not exit to the metro network anymore.

## Gameplay
### Respawn
You spawn from automatic navigo toilets.

### Exploration

### Fights
You can encounter users and fraudsters.

#### Users
You can help users figure out a direction (you direct them to YOUR station).
You can control their ticket and punish them if they do not have the correct one (expired, wrong ticket).

Having users at your station generates a small amount of money every X turns.

#### Fraudsters

They do not have a ticket and no respect for the RATP and its users ! PUNISH THEM ! BANISH THEM !
Killing a fraudster gives you a medium amount of money.

### Powerups
- ability to go back to home station from wherever by creating a temporary service door from any wall
